Performance Tips


*** Fragmentation
*** Index size
*** Non covering index
*** Functions on columns, non equality predicates
Arithmetic operations
*** Significant portion of the index needs to be read
*** Like and leading wildcard
***Inequality Conditions:** such as `<>`, `!=`, `NOT IN`, or `NOT EXISTS`
*** OR conditions especially if no single index can cover
*** Low Selectivity:** If the filter condition is not selective enough
*** Joins on Non-Indexed Columns
sorting or aggregating a large result set
*** Missing Statistics
*** Non indexes on columns frequently used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.
*** put together all filters of a table instead spread out


### 1. **Design Efficient Data Model**
- **Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema:** Choose the schema that best suits your performance needs. Star schemas typically provide better query performance.
- **Fact Table Design:** Ensure that fact tables are properly indexed and partitioned.
- **Dimension Table Design:** Keep dimension tables concise and relevant to the analysis.
### 2. **Optimize Aggregations**
- **Aggregation Design:** Use the Aggregation Design Wizard to create and manage aggregations. Aggregations pre-calculate and store summarized data to speed up queries.
- **Usage-Based Optimization:** Use the Usage-Based Optimization Wizard to create aggregations based on actual query patterns, ensuring that the most frequently accessed data is pre-aggregated.
### 3. **Partitioning**
- **Partition Large Tables:** Partition large fact tables to improve processing time and query performance. Partitions allow parallel processing and querying of data.
- **Incremental Processing:** Use incremental processing for partitions to update only the changed data, reducing processing time.
### 4. **Hierarchies and Attribute Relationships**
- **Define Hierarchies:** Properly define natural hierarchies in dimensions to enhance query performance.
- **Attribute Relationships:** Establish attribute relationships in dimensions to optimize the storage and retrieval of data.
### 5. **Compression and Storage Settings**
- **Compression:** Use data compression techniques to reduce the storage footprint and improve query performance.
- **Storage Modes:** Choose the appropriate storage mode (MOLAP, ROLAP, HOLAP) based on the performance requirements and data update frequency.
• MOLAP: Fast query performance, higher storage requirements, slower updates.
• ROLAP: Lower storage requirements, suitable for large datasets, slower query performance, quicker updates.
• HOLAP: Balance between MOLAP and ROLAP, moderate storage and performance, suitable for mixed scenarios.
### 6. **Caching and Memory Settings**
- **Proactive Caching:** Configure proactive caching to balance the need for real-time data with query performance.
- **Memory Configuration:** Optimize the memory settings in SSAS to ensure that sufficient memory is available for processing and querying operations.
### 7. **Query Optimization**
- **MDX Query Optimization:** Optimize MDX queries by using efficient query patterns, such as avoiding unnecessary calculations and using nonempty clauses.
- **Calculated Members:** Optimize the use of calculated members by pre-calculating where possible and avoiding complex calculations at query time.
### 8. **Processing Optimization**
- **Process in Parallel:** Use parallel processing where possible to reduce the overall processing time.
- **Process Priority:** Adjust the processing priority settings to balance between processing and query performance.
### 9. **Monitoring and Performance Tuning**
- **Profiler and Performance Counters:** Use SQL Server Profiler and performance counters to monitor and analyze the performance of the SSAS server.
- **Identify Bottlenecks:** Identify and address bottlenecks in processing and querying operations.
### 10. **Indexing and Defragmentation**
- **Index Optimization:** Ensure that appropriate indexes are in place on the underlying relational database tables.
- **Defragmentation:** Regularly defragment indexes to maintain optimal query performance.
### Summary
By implementing these optimization techniques, you can significantly improve the performance of your SSAS cubes, leading to faster query responses, efficient processing times, and better resource utilization. 
The goal is to provide a seamless and efficient experience for end-users who rely on the cube data for their analytical needs.
